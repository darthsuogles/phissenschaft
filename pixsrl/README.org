* Carla

  This seems to work best to launch carla server.
  As of <2018-10-14 Sun>, the new =0.9.0 API= has not quite materialized,
  and the "Epic" level rendering is turned off in that branch.
  Thus it is safest to keep to the latest "stable" =0.8.4= release.

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
  docker run -it \
	 -p 2000-2002:2000-2002 \
	 --runtime=nvidia \
	 --ipc=host \
	 --privileged \
	 -v $PWD/CarlaSettings.ini:/home/carla/CarlaSettings.ini \
	 -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
	 -e DISPLAY=:1 \
	 -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1 \
	 carlasim/carla:0.8.4 \
	 /bin/bash
  #+END_SRC


  To build carla, please first build =Unreal Engine 4.19= with the =build_unreal_engine_in_container.sh=.
  Then launch =build_carla.sh= in carla's project root. 
  Notice that one must clone the project (NOT adding it as a submodule).
