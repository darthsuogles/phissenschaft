We use PDFBox to extract data into text format which normal language processing libraries 
could work with. 

In a research paper, there is always a reference section where all 
the cited papers are listed. 
There is no consensus on how such references are formatted, despite the existence of many
standards (APA6, Chicago, etc.). However, usually a few things must be present
- Names of the authors.
- Title of the cited article.
- Venue of publication, which could be a conference, a journal or something else.
- Date of the publication, which contains at least the year. 

A paper listed in the reference section must be cited somewhere in the article. 
Yet neither is there a standard format for this. 

There are some consistency after all. 
For every paper, there should be only one reference style. 

A first task would be to find all the references.
