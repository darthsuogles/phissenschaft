Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these \" reference types \") that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which require integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple – but general – parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to out-perform other models across a variety of tasks, performance metrics, and problem settings .","fragments":[{"start":11,"end":12},{"start":13,"end":21},{"start":32,"end":35},{"start":45,"end":48},{"start":49,"end":59},{"start":60,"end":70},{"start":80,"end":83},{"start":222,"end":232},{"start":233,"end":238},{"start":251,"end":254},{"start":255,"end":264},{"start":265,"end":272},{"start":273,"end":278},{"start":326,"end":329},{"start":418,"end":423},{"start":436,"end":439},{"start":453,"end":454},{"start":726,"end":729},{"start":782,"end":783},{"start":831,"end":836},{"start":846,"end":847},{"start":886,"end":891},{"start":995,"end":998},{"start":1003,"end":1013},{"start":1052,"end":1057},{"start":1101,"end":1102}]},"authors":[{"text":"Hal Daumé III","fragments":[]},{"text":"Daniel Marcu","fragments":[]}],"structuredAuthors":[{"firstName":"Hal","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Daumé","suffix":"III"},{"firstName":"Daniel","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Marcu","suffix":null}],"classifications":[],"year":{"text":"2005","fragments":[]},"venue":{"text":"JMLR","fragments":[]},"followOn":[],"keyPhrases":["KPCA","Supervised Clustering","Dirichlet Process","Reference Type","Coreference Resolution"],"citationContexts":[],"numCitationContexts":0,"citationStats":{"citedByBuckets":[{"startKey":2005,"endKey":2005,"count":2},{"startKey":2006,"endKey":2006,"count":3},{"startKey":2007,"endKey":2007,"count":4},{"startKey":2008,"endKey":2008,"count":4},{"startKey":2010,"endKey":2010,"count":2},{"startKey":2011,"endKey":2011,"count":1},{"startKey":2012,"endKey":2012,"count":1},{"startKey":2013,"endKey":2013,"count":2},{"startKey":2014,"endKey":2014,"count":2}],"numCitations":21,"numReferences":37,"numKeyCitations":0,"numKeyReferences":4,"keyCitationRate":0,"citationVelocity":{"value":1.1926940639269406,"numberOfYears":3,"weights":{"2013":0.7890410958904109,"2014":1,"2015":1,"2016":1}},"citationAcceleration":{"value":-1,"pValue":0}},"pdfLink":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6042/5c772e81d721f96696630b56a2e4611ddeaa.pdf","externalLink":null,"indexInclusionReason":"dblpMatch","debugInfo":null,"journal":{"name":"CoRR","volume":"abs/0907.0808","pages":null},"dataSetNames":null,"socialLinks":[],"badges":[]},{"id":"1e56ed3d2c855f848ffd91baa90f661772a279e1","title":{"text":"Latent Dirichlet Allocation","fragments":[{"start":7,"end":16}]},"slug":"Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation-Blei-Ng","paperAbstract":{"text":"We describe latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation.

Clustering: 50 Years Beyond K-means","fragments":[{"start":5,"end":15}]},"slug":"Data-Clustering-50-Years-Beyond-K-means-Jain","paperAbstract":{"text":"Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering. Advances in sensing and storage technology and dramatic growth in applications such as Internet search, digital imaging, and video surveillance have created many high-volume, high-dimensional data sets. It is estimated that the digital universe consumed approximately 281 exabytes in 2007, and it is projected to be 10 times that size by 2011 (1 exabyte is $10 18 bytes or 1,000,000 terabytes) (Gantz, 2008). Most of the data is stored digitally in electronic media, thus providing huge potential for the development of automatic data analysis, classification, and retrieval techniques. In addition to the growth in the amount of data, the variety of available data (text, image, and video) has also increased. Inexpensive digital and video cameras have made available huge archives of images and videos.

In addition, no algorithm presented in the literature has been tested on more than a handful of object categories. We present an method for learning object categories from just a few training images. It is quick and it uses prior information in a principled way. We test it on a dataset composed of images of objects belonging to 101 widely varied categories. Our proposed method is based on making use of prior information, assembled from (unrelated) object categories which were previously learnt. A generative probabilistic model is used, which represents the shape and appearance of a constellation of features belonging to the object. The parameters of the model are learnt incrementally in a Bayesian manner. Our incremental algorithm is compared experimentally to an earlier batch Bayesian algorithm, as well as to one based on maximum likelihood. The incremental and batch versions have comparable classification performance on small training sets, but incremental learning is significantly faster, making real-time learning feasible. Both Bayesian methods outperform maximum likelihood on small training sets.","fragments":[{"start":179,"end":184},{"start":202,"end":205},{"start":215,"end":222},{"start":263,"end":266},{"start":307,"end":308},{"start":360,"end":363},{"start":401,"end":402},{"start":448,"end":453},{"start":469,"end":470},{"start":501,"end":502},{"start":630,"end":635},{"start":724,"end":725},{"start":751,"end":756},{"start":783,"end":786},{"start":811,"end":812},{"start":852,"end":855},{"start":864,"end":867},{"start":882,"end":885},{"start":886,"end":891},{"start":920,"end":921},{"start":922,"end":930},{"start":1012,"end":1020},{"start":1079,"end":1082},{"start":1272,"end":1280}]},"authors":[{"text":"Li Fei-Fei","fragments":[]},{"text":"Robert Fergus","fragments":[]},{"text":"Pietro Perona","fragments":[]}],"structuredAuthors":[{"firstName":"Li","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Fei-Fei","suffix":null},{"firstName":"Robert","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Fergus","suffix":null},{"firstName":"Pietro","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Perona","suffix":null}],"classifications":[],"year":{"text":"2007","fragments":[]},"venue":{"text":"CVIU","fragments":[]},"followOn":["56e95fa26fb417776824e5adf6d6d511e5b30110","1e41a3fdaac9f306c0ef0a978ae050d884d77d2a","08ae74a8967f7439a3df8733e268caa6294b7e5b","71b038958df0b7855fc7b8b8e7dcde8537a7c1ad","c34ddb031404651fe984bad9680677692400a4ed","0560b48347316d7f9aef29605cac1560aa6fc315","9a8d330e811b7b5f5d32e2c20dbe40c984fad426","1abb05da64b3b0c63936dff1883eb4bf71b18a04","f53c468b875a1535c6e381f29817fe46c36ef018","15b3ebd5a91625be8aebd5f427910df0dd8e2218","20be06193d0d47a7af6943f06a0e9f4eb5c69ebb","31d3b6d531061a34f772a79692f90c84a62bd37d","1351c013261f12ef06d0cf0c6bf92ee39f696194","f7a93270d214257f4e696b92941296a8aa6db41f","e0944e498f6e48d25c93b2786fb629a95a53a649","3d82eab3300bf39c49112da32603e3cb75b677b4","c400bfe3d68306779c2d47083e1b842e20a6e48e","55c42dc5f250c2fd41cb8fb352c88d9ad03a2bc3","3b8bb4992a27804a3c3ebb3ec77b5d09d3c03128","abb886fbee0ef35699b00a45d75a63c5ad6f6812"],"keyPhrases":["Gaussian","Caltech 101 Dataset","Caltech-256","Mnist","Category Learning"],"citationContexts":[],"numCitationContexts":0,"citationStats":{"citedByBuckets":[{"startKey":2005,"endKey":2005,"count":19},{"startKey":2006,"endKey":2006,"count":34},{"startKey":2007,"endKey":2007,"count":42},{"startKey":2008,"endKey":2008,"count":70},{"startKey":2009,"endKey":2009,"count":61},{"startKey":2010,"endKey":2010,"count":82},{"startKey":2011,"endKey":2011,"count":92},{"startKey":2012,"endKey":2012,"count":98},{"startKey":2013,"endKey":2013,"count":107},{"startKey":2014,"endKey":2014,"count":106},{"startKey":2015,"endKey":2015,"count":90},{"startKey":2016,"endKey":2016,"count":9}],"numCitations":812,"numReferences":18,"numKeyCitations":20,"numKeyReferences":0,"keyCitationRate":0.024630541871921183,"citationVelocity":{"value":96.47579908675799,"numberOfYears":3,"weights":{"2013":0.7890410958904109,"2014":1,"2015":1,"2016":1}},"citationAcceleration":{"value":-0.1238018090995005,"pValue":0}},"pdfLink":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/aedb/8df8f953429ec5a6df99fda5c5d71dbee4ff.pdf","externalLink":null,"indexInclusionReason":"dblpMatch","debugInfo":null,"journal":{"name":"Computer Vision and Image Understanding","volume":"106","pages":"59-70"},"dataSetNames":null,"socialLinks":[],"badges":[]},{"id":"9ae252d3b0821303f8d63ba9daf10030c9c97d37","title":{"text":"A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Learning Natural Scene Categories","fragments":[{"start":0,"end":1},{"start":2,"end":10},{"start":24,"end":29},{"start":30,"end":33}]},"slug":"A-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Model-for-Learning-Natural-Fei-Fei-Perona","paperAbstract":{"text":"We propose a novel approach to learn and recognize natural scene categories.

When used in conjunction with statistical techniques, the graph-ical model has several advantages for data analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and prob-abilistic semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in conjunction with Bayesian networks ooer an eecient and principled approach f o r a voiding the overrtting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data.

An active learner may pose queries, usually in the form of unlabeled data instances to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning is well-motivated in many modern machine learning problems, where unlabeled data may be abundant or easily obtained, but labels are difficult, time-consuming, or expensive to obtain. This report provides a general introduction to active learning and a survey of the literature. This includes a discussion of the scenarios in which queries can be formulated, and an overview of the query strategy frameworks proposed in the literature to date. An analysis of the empirical and theoretical evidence for successful active learning, a summary of problem setting variants and practical issues, and a discussion of related topics in machine learning research are also presented.","fragments":[{"start":0,"end":3},{"start":44,"end":45},{"start":102,"end":106},{"start":156,"end":159},{"start":234,"end":237},{"start":305,"end":306},{"start":545,"end":546},{"start":591,"end":592},{"start":603,"end":606},{"start":633,"end":634},{"start":649,"end":652},{"start":718,"end":721},{"start":760,"end":763},{"start":799,"end":802},{"start":838,"end":841},{"start":870,"end":871},{"start":934,"end":935}]},"authors":[{"text":"Burr Settles","fragments":[]}],"structuredAuthors":[{"firstName":"Burr","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Settles","suffix":null}],"classifications":["overviews"],"year":{"text":"2009","fragments":[]},"venue":{"text":"","fragments":[]},"followOn":["987c357180cefe7fa12782396de1418944dcf536","6aa4371416bfe2abc30468ca1d14ba356c66b8e9","0972eaf5fd4109eb1bc474dfeaa52d8c4ad905f9","508921e732afeb5670cb8df077c6b0ec83dd35c2","fe2533594e01b374ee12f8d450069b21b572a675","7d4cfb07f9d3ff357ef1f79e2951522d17c30a10","fd03e10269713703ee251b73f2c8dcf5e8e7e346","0b52e20368dac061b0fd93eb6b67ed0eb56b2ae3","4c29940ef7665ed5a6d9be72260eba488473461d","289bc0353a3163e1675858cefe54f3842160226f","f73f980b020a1dfdf4c017e67d269ea439c7411b","b17970a05a19d7a2fef979f3532e27a0c1cad026","1e3068886b138304ec5a7296702879cc8788143d","c72985efba920b23c0cb68c173d4d4fba21f9fa7","66edc29ff44b9b29f9b1468de7289ee7f8863301","a892f7936bae8220ff8a6d83f542ac901ec397a1","f606d3983a6e807fce6b1670086de9c629cab059","5013ee8bccaefd5c8e32d4784e26bfa65e6687bc","4e3d067938c6666965910fe97c428bb5ef5b59f0","e4b836c10a3ede8d56c66fcfd98ad74f33474368"],"keyPhrases":[],"citationContexts":[],"numCitationContexts":0,"citationStats":{"citedByBuckets":[{"startKey":2009,"endKey":2009,"count":13},{"startKey":2010,"endKey":2010,"count":50},{"startKey":2011,"endKey":2011,"count":92},{"startKey":2012,"endKey":2012,"count":95},{"startKey":2013,"endKey":2013,"count":93},{"startKey":2014,"endKey":2014,"count":112},{"startKey":2015,"endKey":2015,"count":105},{"startKey":2016,"endKey":2016,"count":6}],"numCitations":567,"numReferences":158,"numKeyCitations":20,"numKeyReferences":24,"keyCitationRate":0.03527336860670194,"citationVelocity":{"value":98.79360730593608,"numberOfYears":3,"weights":{"2013":0.7890410958904109,"2014":1,"2015":1,"2016":1}},"citationAcceleration":{"value":-0.10871088757884315,"pValue":0}},"pdfLink":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9f62/ab1e1797bb9ab974a6b8e8a182d82a24f891.pdf","externalLink":null,"indexInclusionReason":"highPrecisionSP","debugInfo":null,"journal":null,"dataSetNames":null,"socialLinks":[],"badges":[]},{"id":"3760df1c9e01d7944f15fac5e077e9ce4520f33e","title":{"text":"Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis","fragments":[]},"slug":"Opinion-Mining-and-Sentiment-Analysis-Pang-Lee","paperAbstract":{"text":"An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.","fragments":[{"start":109,"end":113},{"start":114,"end":117},{"start":359,"end":362},{"start":383,"end":386},{"start":418,"end":421},{"start":481,"end":485},{"start":486,"end":489},{"start":601,"end":602},{"start":622,"end":625},{"start":678,"end":682},{"start":695,"end":696},{"start":885,"end":888},{"start":1167,"end":1170},{"start":1273,"end":1274}]},"authors":[{"text":"Bo Pang","fragments":[]},{"text":"Lillian Lee","fragments":[]}],"structuredAuthors":[{"firstName":"Bo","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Pang","suffix":null},{"firstName":"Lillian","middleNames":[],"lastName":"Lee","suffix":null}],"classifications":["overviews"],"year":{"text":"2007","fragments":[]},"venue":{"text":"FTIR","fragments":[]},"followOn":["fc01b42df3077a512620456d8a2714951eccbd67","25af05944a576f43fc88576ca93c88623db384b1","62eba584631325ede7f7ebf182e36430a0a33f07","ad67b8d4499c0fdf67ce96605aef20bb4a45deb7","29ebf5a58683e1305e250b51554573057fbd7de9","389803c46aaf1285a720ad115bac2a6d1aa7464d","2f9feddc1b0b63d0049be7d0e766eb8a981de4e6","bea8703a408653f1964bbc09cac29f9f3dd96d2a","489a00d2f4b0407c1d7bacfd10d5b418ed9f637f","11c8d08f1a03db5b782df6094c9a6b648cf2892c","10d9246498e6d3ec5d93a7bc5f785a46eadc620d","a4cfa1c06c990e7e6ec9fe148f9843714a01adf7","cc2d75b52cef0dd761c971d3cad0a3f2f6624d8a","23a7c8d9f142184d28e56b0751e172fef6539275","3f257dfd148a7b28664139c3e0d550e8d2223fe1","5d866934e468eaf815b8a88aa7ad226cff321721","4d2f8a1e29ae4e82ee660c8edc107fa05b2e554f","64131d336f50e1646da95fc22892117b0aa814a3","7424786c635a51dad861b8888e9c0d23a5856234","2a5e2c946fe88ee91dbc9132dc560232d4c20628","9c9394c9a037edc3d6c4e516b0612d7737bca082","8b457b87f38a31ae27b20f057b04770d2b5d7d66","58e00cde75cf11589ca53e7d2e62179a80cad19a","20b45fd84ad40582d9ef384550296dc6e6ee2099","0a0bb7f534f73354944fe6e4464d0dc6f96946be","e246afd63a70a787237c64550be32b4aabcf4edc","800ba8341747e902bd0eaf1d1572719b5c60e40d","cdc7655df961df9e8d83e570f8e7f158fc4ef0c6","09196b1a719da59836d83ca557696467e898b0f0","d5dc20ab1133aed9f77d73bf76fbe9ffe8a85dc5","99c7a30a29ff46e1af651cf73fbf13811e589117","3320d97bf6ec4a467712577eb1f74f18fbeadba7","2382542d00f132c161b45457977bcd7ea9a254ab","a8014856354bc0d91701aad9918b5ea97477b010","46b43dfd505ffb9feee31764c4aaedc499506e5e","e08d6a00f5c38d36f317b6f332cf0c4fac5f8acd","08d7138e94e7455e002ab89165b28d55a2b95bcc"],"keyPhrases":["Tweet","Opinion Mining And Sentiment Analysis","Online Review","Computational Treatment","Piece Of Text"],"citationContexts":[],"numCitationContexts":0,"citationStats":{"citedByBuckets":[{"startKey":2008,"endKey":2008,"count":7},{"startKey":2009,"endKey":2009,"count":47},{"startKey":2010,"endKey":2010,"count":133},{"startKey":2011,"endKey":2011,"count":142},{"startKey":2012,"endKey":2012,"count":181},{"startKey":2013,"endKey":2013,"count":211},{"startKey":2014,"endKey":2014,"count":216},{"startKey":2015,"endKey":2015,"count":205},{"startKey":2016,"endKey":2016,"count":14}],"numCitations":1157,"numReferences":333,"numKeyCitations":37,"numKeyReferences":0,"keyCitationRate":0.03197925669835782,"citationVelocity":{"value":200.49589041095888,"numberOfYears":3,"weights":{"2013":0.7890410958904109,"2014":1,"2015":1,"2016":1}},"citationAcceleration":{"value":-0.09738784182126443,"pValue":0}},"pdfLink":"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3760/df1c9e01d7944f15fac5e077e9ce4520f33e.pdf","externalLink":null,"indexInclusionReason":"dblpMatch","debugInfo":null,"journal":{"name":"Foundations and Trends in Information Retrieval","volume":"2","pages":"1-135"},"dataSetNames":null,"socialLinks":[],"badges":[]},{"id":"55ef10672b69aaa4db60faeb3776d85f7af1a5f9","title":{"text":"The nested chinese restaurant process and bayesian nonparametric inference of topic hierarchies","fragments":[{"start":0,"end":3},{"start":30,"end":37},{"start":42,"end":50}]},"slug":"The-nested-chinese-restaurant-process-and-bayesian-Blei-Griffiths","paperAbstract":{"text":"We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process that assigns probability distributions to ensembles of inÞnitely deep, inÞnitely branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. SpeciÞcally, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm Þnds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientiÞc abstracts from several journals. This model exempliÞes a recent trend in statistical machine learning—the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on ßexible data structures.

We focus on a semi-supervised framework that incorporates labeled and unlabeled data in a general-purpose learner. Some transductive graph learning algorithms and standard methods including Support Vector Machines and Regularized Least Squares can be obtained as special cases. We utilize properties of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert spaces to prove new Representer theorems that provide theoretical basis for the algorithms. As a result (in contrast to purely graph-based approaches) we obtain a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and so are able to handle both transductive and truly semi-supervised settings. We present experimental evidence suggesting that our semi-supervised algorithms are able to use unlabeled data effectively. Finally we have a brief discussion of unsupervised and fully supervised learning within our general

Our Infinite Skip-Gram (iSG) model specifies an energy-based joint distribution over a word vector, a context vector, and their dimensionality, which can be defined over a countably infinite domain by employing the same techniques used to make the Infinite Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Côté & Larochelle, 2015) tractable. We find that the distribution over embedding dimensionality for a given word is highly interpretable and leads to an elegant probabilistic mechanism for word sense induction. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that the iSG produces parameter-efficient representations that are robust to language's inherent ambiguity.","fragments":[]},"authors":[{"text":"Eric T.
